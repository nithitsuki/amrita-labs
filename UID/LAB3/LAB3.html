        <h3 id="Koro-sensei">Koro-sensei</h3>
        <img alt="Korosensei"
            src="https://github.com/nithitsuki/amrita-labs/blob/main/UID/LAB3/imgs/Koro-sensei.jpg?raw=true" width="123"
            height="103">
        <p>Koro-sensei is the main protagonist of the series 'Assassination Classroom'. He is a highly skilled and
            powerful teacher who is tasked with educating the students of Class 3-E while also being a target for
            assassination. His true nature, as well as his tragic backstory, becomes an important aspect of the story as
            he teaches his students important life lessons.</p>

        <h3 id="Kaede Kayano">Kaede Kayano</h3>
        <img alt="Kaede Kayano"

            width="123" height="103">
        <p>Kaede Kayano is one of the students in Class 3-E. Initially appearing as a cheerful and somewhat naive
            student, she becomes a central character whose story reveals deeper emotions and growth throughout the

            narrative.</p>

        <h3 id="Karma Akabane">Karma Akabane</h3>
        <img alt="Karma Akabane"
            src="https://github.com/nithitsuki/amrita-labs/blob/main/UID/LAB3/imgs/Karma%20Akabane.jpg?raw=true"
            width="123" height="103">
        <p>Karma Akabane is known for his rebellious and intelligent nature. Despite being one of the most troublesome
            students in Class 3-E, Karma possesses exceptional intellect and a sharp wit. His rivalry with Koro-sensei
            becomes one of the highlights of the series, and over time, he matures into a more thoughtful and strategic
            individual.</p>


        <h3 id="Tadaomi Karasuma">Tadaomi Karasuma</h3>
        <img alt="Tadaomi Karasuma"
            src="https://github.com/nithitsuki/amrita-labs/blob/main/UID/LAB3/imgs/Tadaomi%20Karasuma.jpg?raw=true"
            width="123" height="103">
        <p>Tadaomi Karasuma is a professional government agent assigned to assist in the assassination mission against
            Koro-sensei. He is highly disciplined, skilled, and often comes into conflict with the students of Class 3-E
            due to his serious nature. Despite his no-nonsense attitude, he forms a bond with the class and plays a key
            role in the development of the students.</p>

        <h3 id="Gakushu Asano">Gakushu Asano</h3>
        <img alt="Gakushuuchar"
            src="https://github.com/nithitsuki/amrita-labs/blob/main/UID/LAB3/imgs/Gakushu%20Asano.jpg?raw=true"
            width="123" height="103">
        <p>Gakushu Asano is a brilliant and highly ambitious student who comes from a prestigious family. He is the son
            of Gakuho Asano, the chairman of the school, and he initially comes across as a calm and collected person.
            Gakushu is highly competitive and has a strong desire to prove himself, often putting him at odds with the
            students of Class 3-E. His intense focus on academics makes him an important figure in the series, as he
            strives to surpass Koro-sensei.</p>

        <h3 id="Itona Horibe">Itona Horibe</h3>
        <img alt="Itonachar"
            src="https://github.com/nithitsuki/amrita-labs/blob/main/UID/LAB3/imgs/Itona%20Horibe.jpg?raw=true"
            width="123" height="103">
        <p>Itona Horibe is a character introduced later in the series, initially appearing as a rival to Koro-sensei. He
            is a former student of the same organization that created Koro-sensei and has been modified to be an
            artificial human with similar abilities. Itona's struggle with his identity and his desire to surpass
            Koro-sensei adds a layer of complexity to his character as he begins to realize the value of friendship and
            personal growth.</p>

        <h3 id="Kotaro Takebayashi">Kotaro Takebayashi</h3>
        <img alt="Kotaro Takebayashi"
            src="https://github.com/nithitsuki/amrita-labs/blob/main/UID/LAB3/imgs/Kotaro%20Takebayashi.jpg?raw=true"
            width="123" height="103">
        <p>Kotaro Takebayashi is one of the students in Class 3-E who stands out due to his stoic personality. He is
            known for being incredibly focused and serious in his approach to both school and his assassination attempts
            on Koro-sensei. Though he may appear emotionless at times, he is a loyal and dependable student who
            contributes greatly to the class's dynamic as they work together to take down their teacher.</p>

        <h3 id="Gakuho Asano">Gakuho Asano</h3>
        <img alt="Gakuho Asano"
            src="https://github.com/nithitsuki/amrita-labs/blob/main/UID/LAB3/imgs/Gakuho%20Asano.jpg?raw=true"
            width="123" height="103">
        <p>Gakuho Asano is the strict and authoritarian chairman of the school and the father of Gakushu Asano. He is an
            influential and imposing figure, known for his rigid view on education and his belief in superiority through
            intellect and discipline. Gakuho's interactions with Class 3-E often reflect his disdain for their perceived
            lack of academic ability, creating tension with both the students and faculty. His role in the story adds an
            element of institutional conflict as he seeks to control and reform the educational system.</p>
